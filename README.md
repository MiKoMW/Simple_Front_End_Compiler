# Simple_Front_End_Compiler

This is a simple compiler from C to three address intermediate code.

This compiler follows the Dragon book, Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools. This is a brilliant book which I would like to recommend everyone interested in compelling as an introduction.

I will complete it to a full size C to mips compiler during my reading.
